# breadth-first-search-traversal-git-in-eclipse-not-github-desktop-not-in-workspace-confusion-master
this is for breadth first search. I am trying to use git in eclipse, not github desktop. I created the folder not in eclipse workspace. I ran into some confusion with master and main so I am creating a new repository.
